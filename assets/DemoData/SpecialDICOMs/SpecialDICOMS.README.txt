This directory contains some DICOM files with 
the following specialties:

-PhotometricIntepretation is MONOCHROME1, PALETTE, or YBR_FULL.

-The DICOM tags RescaleIntercept and RescaleSlope differ 
 between DICOM frames.

Since not all of these files are normally readable with ImageLoad
the corresponding .mlimage files are also available in a parallel 
directory to provide loadable alternative version.

See example network ApplyDicomPixelModifiers to import these 
DICOM files with DirectDicomImport, to transform the pixel 
data with ApplyDicomPixelModifiers and to display them correctly.
